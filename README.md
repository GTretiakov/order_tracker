# Order Tracker
This project is an application designed for internal use by a [distribution company](https://kolonakigroup.com/). The purpose of this application is to provide better coordination between differrent departments inside the company. The company sells different categories of products (mostly wines and foods) via different platforms (such as Amazon and Shopify) as well as direct purchases. The application helps to organize big amount of orders that come to the company daily in such a way that all orders can be grouped in different categories ('stores') and every order clearly represents its current status and can be updated by a respective department accordingly.

## UX
An inspiration for this project comes from [monday.com](https://monday.com/), an environment that helps companies to organize and manage their work process, and which is now used by my client.
